[Link](https://lenincodes.co/vitc-timetable-example/)

This is a mini project that i'm building with LocalStorage API.

## Idea

You can **view** your timetable on thise website once you fill it here. You won't need to log in everytime to Vtop or open the screenshot of your timetable.

## Note

Currently you can only view this website on desktop
